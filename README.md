Code for the sixth independent project for Android Basics in Kotlin. This project pairs
with Unit 6 of Android Basics in Kotlin

The Water Me! app consists of a list of plants, some information about them, and a description for how often each one should be watered. For each of these plants, the app schedule a reminder for when they should be watered.

Reminders will be displayed as notifications on the device, even if the Water Me! app is not running. Tapping a notification launches the Water Me! app.
